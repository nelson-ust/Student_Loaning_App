# Development Environment

1. Visual studio Code and Android studio were the development tools used in developing the Backend and frontend applications respectively. These are our favourites because they're lightweight and flexible. 
2. The Python programming language with python3 was used to complete the Backend project. It is very easy to use,  unique language and serves as a multi purpose language. I used the DJango framework alongside SQL DB and Kotlin for the frontend project.
3. I used GitHub for version control.
