# Development Environment

1. Visual studio Code was the development tool used in developing this App. This is one of my favorites because it is lightweight and flexible. 
2. The Python programming language with python3 was used to complete this project. It is very easy to use,  unique language and serves as a multi purpose language. I used the DJango framework alongside SQLIte DB and Bootstrap library for the UI
3. I used GitHub for version control.
